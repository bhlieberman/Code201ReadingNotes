## CSS Transforms

CSS Transforms allow the developer to make changes to element's sizing and position in all three dimensions. This means objects can be rotated, resized, or moved. An example of such a transform would be rotating an object around the X axis of the page. This feature might be used to add a spinner or some other kind of rudimentary animation to your page, conditioned on user interaction.

## CSS Transitions and Animations

CSS Transitions can alter an object's state over time. This was previously only possible using JavaScript. But now CSS3 provides the `transition` property on an object to change its color or size or any other aspect based on some event, like a mouse hover.

CSS Animations allow stateful transitions across multiple states. Regular transitions only cover a starting and ending state. Animations allow for mulitple mid-points to make an object's transition more interesting.

Using CSS transitions and animations make a website more interactive and engaging for a user. This could mean putting emphasis on particular elements by changing their state when the user hovers over them or performs some other kind of interaction.

I want to continue to improve my CSS skills and this is another tool I now have at my disposal. I hope that as my knowledge of advanced CSS features expands, it will make writing CSS more interesting for me.

## Reading 14b

Based on my reading of this NYT article and the follow-up lecture on "Psychological Safety", I feel that such studies are generally speaking not useful. They satisfy a narrow subset of readers who want to peel back the curtain on what it means to run a successful company, but don't consider anything outside of the small part of the company's success that is supposedly predicated on the subject of the study.

If it is not quite a confirmation bias, then it is something else that is the result of statistical/analytical confounding. One comment on the article summed it up effectively by pointing out that the caliber of people who work at Google do not make for useful subjects for this kind of behavioral study because they are well-educated professionals who likely don't have much to disagree about.
