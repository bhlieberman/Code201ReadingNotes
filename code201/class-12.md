## JavaScript Canvas

The `<canvas>` tag allows web developers to draw shapes in the browser window.

The tag must be closed because it uses fallback content, unlike the `img` tag, which has `alt` text. If the browser does not support the `<canvas>` tag, the fallback content will be displayed instead. This content goes between the opening and closing tags.

The `.getContext()` method returns the canvas to be modified. It is the main API for accessing and changing the canvas.

## ChartJS

ChartJS is an external JavaScript library for creating data visualizations in your code. It can be installed from `npm` and imported or through a `script` tag in your HTML.

Chart types creatable by ChartJS

* bar
* pie
* line

## Advantages of charts/visualizations

Any way to visualize data is beneficial. But tables sometimes play the unfortunate auxiliary role of a formatting tool in web pages, which charts and other vizualizations will never have.

Charts would be useful in the completed Salmon Cookies app as a replacement or supplement for the tabular data on the sales page. It is easier to compare store-to-store data visually than in a table.
