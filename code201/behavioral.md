Behavioral Questions:
1. Question 1: Why did you leave your last job? 
   a. Situation: I worked for a small business that specialized in healthcare analytics. I did some part-time programming and data analysis work, primarily in Python. I had weekly meetings with my supervisor but these were not guaranteed to occur and often resulted in lack of coordination on projects.
   b. Task: I decided to leave my job late last year. I felt that my talents could be better utilized in an environment with more structure.
   c. Action: I began conducting my job search in October 2021. I did research and filled out applications to companies where I felt I might be a good fit. I worked both on my own and with recruiters. I maintained a LinkedIn profile to aid in my search and boost my visibility to hiring managers.
   d. Result: I decided to attend a bootcamp to broaden my experience and get some more hands-on experience working with others. My previous work was often done in isolation and this made it difficult to describe for interviewers looking for concrete examples of working in a team-based environment. 
2. Question 2: What is your greatest accomplishment? 
   a. Situation: This is not a strictly professional achievement, or not in the corporate sense at least. I wrote a novel and it is to be published soon. My writing skills are a source of great satisfaction and pride to me. It makes me an effective communicator in general, but it has obvious and useful applications to the workplace as well.
   b. Task: I had to appropriately manage my time between my various responsibilities and basic needs in order to have time to write. Additionally, writing, particularly creative writing, is not always a linear task. It can be organized to have a semblance of chronology, but in some sense you are always beholden to inspiration and lack of knowledge that will drive the narrative forward. Moreover, despite the solitary nature of doing the writing, finding a publisher can be challenging and enervating in the extreme. It involves a ton of legwork and a unique degree of self-effacement and self-promotion. I wrote the book by ensuring I put in time every morning no matter what the actual product of these sessions were. 30mins to 1hr of work depending on my schedule.
   c. Action/Result: With natural adjustments for mitigating circumstances, I stuck to this schedule and completed an (approx.) 380pp novel in 2.5 years, reusing some old material that predates this period. I was lucky enough to find a publisher quickly enough, but in order to do this, I used social media connections to network with others who work in the industry. I emailed with them, listened to their suggestions, and made the corresponding changes to my manuscript, while doing my best to stay true to my own intentions.
