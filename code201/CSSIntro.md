# Intro to CSS

## What is CSS?

CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a rules-based programming language. It is embedded in HTML documents and adds style to the page by *selecting* HTML elements and modifying them.

## How do you use it?

CSS can be used on your webpage by using a `<style></style>` tag and adding your desired effects directly in the HTML document. Or, you can create a `foo.css` file and link it to your webpage using the `<link rel="stylesheet" href=foo.css>` tag.

## What can you use it for?

You can modify almost any aspect of your website's style using CSS. Font size, width, color; background color; buttons; images; text positions; links; & more.

## Is there a way to apply non-global styles?

Granularity in CSS can be achieved using IDs in your HTML tags. You can also add the `class` attribute to your HTML tags and select them in CSS by following this convention: `.class-name`
