## Learn HTML

### Creating links

Creating a hyperlink is done by wrapping text in the `<a>` element. This stands for anchor, and it is given the `href` attribute with the value of the desired URL. The links can be made accessible by using alt text.

## CSS Layout

### Normal flow

A webpage is laid out in normal flow if no CSS has been applied.

Static positioning is the default for every HTML element.

Absolute positioned elements exist in their own "layer" that permits them to be modified/moved around without interfering with other parts of the UI. It also means that the absolutely positioned element is only dependent on the position/sizing of its direct ancestor.

Fixed positioning is like absolute positioning except that the element depends not on its direct ancestor but the entire visible part of the viewport.

### Functions

A function declaration defines what the function's behavior is, the number of parameters it takes, etc. A function is invoked when a programmer uses the function's name followed by parentheses in which are included as many arguments as the function takes.

A parameter is the kind of data a function is defined to take. An argument is the actual instance of the data passed into the function's scope when it is called.

## Pair programming

The biggest benefits of pair programming for me are the ability to talk through the problem and the different ways in which people think about problems. I sometimes miss things that are very obvious to other people, and it is very helpful to have them around to point out what I'm doing wrong, and vice versa. In the same way that writing out project requirements can be helpful before writing any code, talking about the problem and its constraints before doing so can be equally useful.
