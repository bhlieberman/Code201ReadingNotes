### Site Description

Here lies the notes for Ben's Code 201 reading assignments. This will be a central repository for all learning material. Made with love in Emacs `markdown_mode`. 

#### JavaScript Notes

JavaScript makes websites interactive through manipulation of their Document Object Model, or DOM.

#### HTML Notes

The main source for these notes is [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). I also make references[^1] to the [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), a helpful resource for all things web development.

#### CSS Notes

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
