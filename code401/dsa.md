# Discussion questions

1. How the data structure behaves: its speed for insertion/deletion, whether it can be indexed/search quickly, etc. 
2. In order to terminate a recursive function, there must be a base case. Some languages (not Java) also optimize tail calls, which uses the same stack frame in recursive calls, as opposed to adding a new stack frame for each new invocation of the recursive function.
