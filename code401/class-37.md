# Amazon S3 and Amplify

S3 is the Simple Storage Service. It is a scalable object storage service provided for storing content like images. It is integrated with Amplify for ease-of-use in bootstrapping applications. You can add S3 to your Amplify app using the `amplify add storage` command in the terminal if you have the Amplify CLI installed.

Once you have the components added to your Amplify backend, you can configure S3 operability in your application with the plugin provided on your language's repository.
