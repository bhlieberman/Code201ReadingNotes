## Objects

Objects are the fundamental abstraction in object-oriented programming. They encapsulate the state and the behavior of something, and are used to model that thing in software. State can be described as the physical characteristics of something, like a computer that can be on, off, or in sleep (low power) mode. Behavior is the ways someone interacts with that object to change its state.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is how data is hidden in an application that uses the OO paradigm. Data is contained in classes and objects that are only acted upon by methods internal to that class.

## Classes

Classes provide a basic unit of abstraction that describe and expose objects to the rest of the program. They can provide a general set of behaviors that can be extended by other classes to create a larger program.

## Numbers

Decimal numbers are the ones humans use to count. It is a base 10 system.
Binary is used by computers and is base 2. It consists only of 1s and 0s.
Hexadecimal is also used by computers to encode data at a higher level than binary. It consists of the numbers 0-9 and the letters A-F.
