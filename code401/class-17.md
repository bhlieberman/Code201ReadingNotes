## OAuth2 and Spring

I will follow through and do this tutorial soon because authentication is still rather mystifying for me. I think the general idea though is to ask for a token from the server and get a response. OAuth uses an authorization grant, which is exchanged by the client to the server. The client receives a token if authorized and nothing if not.
