# OSS Contributions

I have already done some OSS work so I have gotten over the initial fear of having my work rejected (fortunately it wasn't). But now that I have, I want to participate in more ambitious work, so I need to get over the hump of feeling like I don't have the skills or intelligence to contribute to significant or complex codebases.

I want to know more about how to branch out from this beginner's limbo to an intermediate stage, where I can add meaningful contributions to code that solves real-world problems.
