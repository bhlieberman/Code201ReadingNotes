# Class 32

1. APIs are RESTful if they provide distinct endpoints for performing certain operations on data.
2. GraphQL unifies multiple API endpoints into one and allows for queries that are of different granularities and types.
3. Serverless is a buzzword that means you don't provision and manage your own computing resources. This is done for you by a service provider and the functionality is then exposed to you over HTTP.
