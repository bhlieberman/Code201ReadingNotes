# Hash tables

The hash table data structure, also called a dictionary or map in some languages, represents an iterable sequence of data stored as key-value pairs. Unlike other sequences, the data is not added in a sequential manner. A hash is computed when a key is provided; the result of this computation determines the position of the key-value pair in the map.

Hashes are computed using a hashing function, which is an algebraic equation that is designed to minimize what are known as collisions; which is the occurrence of two distinct keys being mapped to the same hash. This can result in an incoming value evicting a present one.
