## DRY and the Rule of Three

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a programming principle aimed at minimizing the reuse of boilerplate code. It has a corollary, the Rule of Three, that stipulates three usages of the same code merits a refactor. In this week's lab work, I ended up using an `abstract` class to replace my original implementations due to too much repetitive logic.

## You Aren't Gonna Need It

This is a programming principle that arose from "extreme programming". It says that features should never be implemented before the programmer knows them to be absolutely necessary. This is an important thing for me to keep in mind as I have a tendency to get easily sidetracked by experimets.
