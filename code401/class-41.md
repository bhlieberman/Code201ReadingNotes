# AWS analytics and text-to-speech

AWS offers two services for these needs, Pinpoint and Polly. Pinpoint can be used for real-time analytics and user updates, like passwords, price changes (for a stock app etc). Polly is a text-to-speech service offering accurate and life-like reading of text in an application that is compliant with several security standards for proprietary data like HIPAA.
