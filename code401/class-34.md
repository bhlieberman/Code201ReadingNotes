# App publication

In order to publish your app, you must first ensure you have a production build ready. All services and data your app depends upon must also be available and secure. You then can use any means of distributing your application as you desire, including private repos, an app marketplace like Google Play, or individual distribution to a customer. 

## Using Google Play to publish

This process involves three steps: 

1. Preparing promotional materials -- create advertisements, take screenshots, etc.
2. Configure your app for various local markets -- set prices by country, pick languages supported
3. Publish
