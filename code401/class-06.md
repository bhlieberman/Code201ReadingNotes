## Difference b/w object and class

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. They define the state and behavior of objects.

## Design patterns

## A design pattern is a way to describe common programming styles that are separate from business logic. It often consists of a particular abstraction over a frequent operation, like connecting to a database.

## Static methods

Static methods are sometimes called class methods (as in Python.) This is because they are accessed directly on the class itself, but can also be accessed through an instance of the class.
