# Android Shared Preferences and testing

1. Shared Preferences are like Local Storage in the browser.
2. To account for all the possible states your UI will be in when being interacted with by the user; to make sure there are no bugs in your code; to test inputs; and to make sure all parts of your applications function properly when put together (integration testing). Integration testing is the most important to me.
3. Tasks and the back stack are like history in the browser.
