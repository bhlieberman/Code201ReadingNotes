# AWS Amplify and Cognito

Cognito is an AWS service for user authentication. It is bundled into the Amplify suite as a component, so that developers can add it as a feature to their app from the Amplify CLI. Cognito has a different interface depending on the language, but the general concept is to add the ability to protect resources and data behind authentication that is done using a session.
